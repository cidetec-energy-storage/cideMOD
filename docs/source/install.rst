Installation
=============

The preferred way to install and use cideMOD is using the conda-forge 
feedstock for dolfinx. Optionally, one can install cideMOD using the Docker image 
or in a FEniCSx working environment (with multiphenicsx) by downloading everything 
from source and installing it with the Python package manager.
