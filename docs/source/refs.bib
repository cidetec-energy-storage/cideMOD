abstract = {An isothermal, multimodal, physics-based aging model for life prediction of Li-ion batteries is developed, for which a solvent-decomposition reaction leading to the growth of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the carbonaceous anode material is considered as the source of capacity fade. The rate of SEI film growth depends on both solvent diffusion through the SEI film and solvent-reduction kinetics at the carbon surface. The model is able to simulate a wide variety of battery aging profiles, e.g., open-circuit and constant-voltage storage, charge/discharge cycling, etc. An analysis of capacity-fade data from the literature reveals that the same set of aging parameters may be used for predicting cycling and constant-voltage storage. The use of this set of parameters for predicting storage under open-circuit voltage points out that part of the self-discharge is reversible. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Electrochemical Society.},

@article{Ayerbe2020,
abstract = {Dimensionless analysis arises as an appropriate methodology to study battery cells behavior since it brings the opportunity to identify limiting mechanisms in the battery cell performance by analysing a reduced number of dimensionless parameters. These parameters are obtained by condensating the physical dimensional parameters involved in the description of the electrochemical phenomena taking place in the cell. Here, based on the well known Doyle, Fuller and Newman model [M. Doyle, T.F. Fuller, J. Newman, J. Electrochem. Soc., 140(6) 1526â€“1533 (1993)] (DFN model, in short), a comprehensive set of dimensionless parameters is derived and the information arising from each dimensionless parameter is explained. Application to the design of a solid polymer electrolyte cell is considered, where limiting transport mechanisms are identified through dimensionless parameters analysis and guidelines for a cell redesign are also drawn from this analysis. Predictions made by inspection of the derived comprehensive set of dimensionless parameters are validated both numerically (using the DFN model) and experimentally.},

@article{Ai2020,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2019. Whilst extensive research has been conducted on the effects of temperature in lithium-ion batteries, mechanical effects have not received as much attention despite their importance. In this work, the stress response in electrode particles is investigated through a pseudo-2D model with mechanically coupled diffusion physics. This model can predict the voltage, temperature and thickness change for a lithium cobalt oxide-graphite pouch cell agreeing well with experimental results. Simulations show that the stress level is overestimated by up to 50% using the standard pseudo-2D model (without stress enhanced diffusion), and stresses can accelerate the diffusion in solid phases and increase the discharge cell capacity by 5.4%. The evolution of stresses inside electrode particles and the stress inhomogeneity through the battery electrode have been illustrated. The stress level is determined by the gradients of lithium concentration, and large stresses are generated at the electrode-separator interface when high C-rates are applied, e.g. fast charging. The results can explain the experimental results of particle fragmentation close to the separator and provide novel insights to understand the local aging behaviors of battery cells and to inform improved battery control algorithms for longer lifetimes.},

@article{Chen2020,
abstract = {Presented here, is an extensive 35 parameter experimental data set of a cylindrical 21700 commercial cell (LGM50), for an electrochemical pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model. The experimental methodologies for tear-down and subsequent chemical, physical, electrochemical kinetics and thermodynamic analysis, and their accuracy and validity are discussed. Chemical analysis of the LGM50 cell shows that it is comprised of a NMC 811 positive electrode and bi-component Graphite-SiOx negative electrode. The thermodynamic open circuit voltages (OCV) and lithium stoichiometry in the electrode are obtained using galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) in half cell and three-electrode full cell configurations. The activation energy and exchange current coefficient through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Apparent diffusion coefficients are estimated using the Sand equation on the voltage transient during the current pulse; an expansion factor was applied to the bi- component negative electrode data to reflect the average change in effective surface area during lithiation. The 35 parameters are applied within a P2D model to show the fit to experimental validation LGM50 cell discharge and relaxation voltage profiles at room temperature. The accuracy and validity of the processes and the techniques in the determination of these parameters are discussed, including opportunities for further modelling and data analysis improvements.},
