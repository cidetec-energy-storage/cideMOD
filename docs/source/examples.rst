Use cases
==========

In the repository or docker image, several use cases are included
together with corresponding literature datasets used in the examples.
It is recommended to go through the jupyter notebooks that can be found
within the `examples/notebooks` folder.

.. _examples:

Datasets
---------

- Chen_2020: Graphite-SiliconOxide vs NMC811 cell based on :cite:p:`Chen2020`
    Electrochemical parameters
- Ai_2020: Graphite vs LCO cell based on :cite:p:`Ai2020`
    Electrochemical and thermal parameters
- Safari_2009: Graphite vs LCO cell based on :cite:p:`Safari2009`
    Electrochemical and SEI parameters

Examples
---------

Single discharge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is one of the most basic use cases of cideMOD, to simulate a
single discharge using the low-level Problem interface.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/main.py

Storage
^^^^^^^^

In this case, using the CSI interface, we can simulate the
degradation under rest conditions.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/storage.py

Cycling
^^^^^^^^

Using a different test plan, we can simulate a cycling protocol:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/cycling.py
