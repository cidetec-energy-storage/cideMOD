Geometry and mesh
------------------

The cideMOD library works on top of FEniCSx :cite:p:`FEniCSx` using
finite elements to solve the PDEs that represent the cell physics. It
is designed to work on any geometry or mesh that has been
properly tagged. However, using FEniCSx and Gmsh :cite:p:`gmsh`, cideMOD
is able to create automatically realistic 3D meshes of batteries in
pouch cell format with different dimensions and tab positions.

There are different subdomains in the model:

* Current Collector:
   Current collectors are parts of the cell that conduct electricity,
   but not ions. There are two types, the positive current collector
   (tag=``pcc"), which connects cathode electrodes, and the negative
   current collector (tag=``ncc"), which connects anode electrodes.
   Additionally, the current collectors are conected to the
   input/output of the cell at the tabs.
* Electrode:
   Electrodes are porous materials composed by active material, binder
   and conductive agents, in which the pores are filled with
   electrolyte. They conduct electrons through the solid phase and ions
   through the electrolyte (ionic) phase, and exchange ions between the
   solid phase and the electrolyte. There are two types of electrodes,
   the anode (tag=``a") which has the lower Open Circuit Potential, and
   the cathode (tag=``c"), which has the higher Open Circuit Potential.
* Separator
   The separator (tag=``s") is a porous material filled with electrolyte.
   The solid part of the separator does not conduct electrons nor ions.
   It is inert to the charge carriers.

The dimensions of these domains can be customized in the cell parameter
JSON file. The structure of the cell can be customized up to certain level.
There are other parts of the cell, that do not need to be meshed, but
are automatically considered by the model:

* Electrolyte:
   The solution composed by solvents (e.g., EC:DMC) and salts (e.g., LiPF\ :sub:`6`) 
   that fill the electrodes and separator pores. It is ion conductive, but not
   electron conductive.
* Sealing:
   The cell is usually sealed with some materials that prevents mass
   and charge exchange with the environment. However, these materials
   have an influence on the energy exchange with the surroundings. Such
   effect is accounted for in the thermal model as an overall heat transfer 
   coefficient.


Submodels
----------

Depending on the physics of the mechanisms taking place in each domain,
a different set of variables is taken into account on each domain. Here
we define the models included in cideMOD and the domains that they
involve.

* Electrochemical model:
   Electrolyte potential and concentration (:math:`\varphi_\mathrm{e}` and
   :math:`c_\mathrm{e}`) are defined in the electrodes as well as in the
   separator. Solid phase potential (:math:`\phi_\mathrm{s}`) is defined only at
   the electrodes. At the current collectors there is also a solid
   phase potential but due to the disparity of conductivity scales,
   another variable is created :math:`\phi_\mathrm{s,cc}`, and continuity is
   imposed at the interface between electrode and current collectors
   with a lagrange multiplier. Particle concentration (:math:`c_\mathrm{s}`\)
   and intercalation current density (:math:`j_\mathrm{Li}`) are also defined
   as variables but only at their corresponding electrode. This means
   that each electrode has many of these variables as active materials.
* Thermal model:
   Temperature (:math:`T`) is a scalar function defined in all of the
   domains. Heat sources considered are ohmic, polarization and
   reaction heat sources. In isothermal simulations
   (solve\_thermal=False) the temperature is set as a constant value
   over the domain.
* Degradation models:

  * SEI growth model:
     The anode SEI model implemented is based on :cite:t:`Safari2009`
     and it assumes that the electrolyte solvent concentration
     (primarily EC and DMC) is the limiting factor for SEI growth.
     Therefore, solvent species (:math:`c_\mathrm{\scriptscriptstyle EC}`) transport across the
     SEI is solved with an spectral method using Laplace polynomials.
     Additionally, the side reaction current density and SEI thickness are
     defined in the anode 
     (:math:`j_\mathrm{\scriptscriptstyle SEI}` and :math:`\delta_\mathrm{\scriptscriptstyle SEI}`).

  * LAM model:
     The LAM model estimates the loss of active material due to particle
     cracking driven by stresses. Therefore, the decrease of the volume
     fraction of active material (:math:`\varepsilon_\mathrm{s}`) is
     computed as described on :cite:t:`OKane_2022` and implemented
     following an explicit Euler time integration scheme. Hydrostatic
     stresses (:math:`\sigma_\mathrm{h}`) are computed following the
     stress model described on :cite:t:`Zhang_2007`.


Pseudo-dimension
-----------------
So far we have talked about meshes for the cell, but in the PXD models
there is a pseudodimension (what P stands for in P2D, P3D, P4D)
corresponding to the active materials inner domain. This is not
explicitly considered, but an homogeneization links the internal state
of such domains with the rest of the model.
In cideMOD, we solve the pseudodimension with an sprectral approach.
Therefore, we consider a set of global basis functions (even Legendre
polynomials) and assume that the solution is a linear combination of
those. Thus, we can solve the problem in a single mesh and FEniCSx
matrix.

Additionally, as the particle model is only connected to the rest of
the cell through the particle interface, the properties of the Legendre
polynomials are used to reduce coupling at the jacobian level. Thus, the
concentration in the domain has been decomposed as:

.. math::

   \begin{gathered}
       \hat{c}_\mathrm{s} (\hat{r}, \hat{x}, \hat{t}) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} L_{2i}
       (\hat{r}) \hat{c}_{\mathrm{s},i} (\hat{x}, \hat{t}) 
   \end{gathered}

Taking advantage of the properties of Legendre polinomials,
as :math:`L_i(1) = 1`, we can substitute the zeroth order
coefficient with a new variable :math:`\hat{c}^\mathrm{surf}_\mathrm{s}` representing the
concentration at the particles surface:

.. math::

   \begin{gathered}
       \hat{c}_\mathrm{s}(1,\hat{x},\hat{t}) = \hat{c}^\mathrm{surf}_\mathrm{s} = \sum_{i=0}^{n}
       L_{2i} (1) \hat{c}_{\mathrm{s},i} (\hat{x}, \hat{t}) = \sum_{i=0}^{n}
       \hat{c}_{\mathrm{s},i} (\hat{x}, \hat{t}) \\
       \hat{c}_\mathrm{s} (\hat{r}, \hat{x}, \hat{t}) = L_0 \left(\hat{c}^\mathrm{surf}_\mathrm{s}
       - \sum_{i=1}^{n}\hat{c}_{\mathrm{s},i} (\hat{x}, \hat{t})\right)
       + \sum_{i=1}^{n} L_{2i} (\hat{r}) \hat{c}_{\mathrm{s},i}(\hat{x},\hat{t})
   \end{gathered}

This change of variable reduces the jacobian entries, and the
calculations needed to evaluate entries of the lithium intercalation
flux.

P2D vs P4D
------------
P2D model is very handy for fast calculations; however, for bigger cells,
the P4D model is more realistic and considers the heterogeneities in
the cell. There are several differences in the implementation of the
P2D and P4D motivated by the difference in complexity of both models.
Although both models contains the same submodels, the implementation is
different in the two cases:

.. rubric:: P2D

As the P2D model as simpler, it uses standard FEniCSx interval meshes
to discretize the 1D cell domain in transversal direction. Each of the
subdomains is normalized to (0,1) and therefore, the mesh never changes
for the same type of cell even when the dimensions of the different
subdomains changes.


.. rubric:: P4D

Given the necessity of modeling details in 3D (for example, current
collector tabs), the normalization strategy, used to get a simpler mesh
that could be generated with FEniCSx does not work anymore. In this case,
it is preferred to use the real geometry of the cell, generated with Gmsh.
Due to the disparity of scales in the real cell geometry and in order
to incorporate contributions from all the residuals in a proper way,
the equations are non-dimensionalized. This makes real cell geometry representations
possible, but as a consequence, each time the geometry changes, 
the mesh needs to change, and the FEniCSx engine has to
recompile part of the solver code.
